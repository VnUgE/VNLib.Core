# VNLib.Net.Transport.SimpleTCP

*A managed .NET simple, high performance - single process, low/no allocation, fully asynchronous, TCP socket server.*

This library was created for use with the VNLib.Net.Http library and subsequent stacked framework libraries, however it was designed to be useful as a standalone high-performance .NET TCP listener. This library relies on the managed .NET [System.IO.Pipelines](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/main/docs/standard/io/pipelines.md) library, and the [VNLib.Utils](../Utils) library.

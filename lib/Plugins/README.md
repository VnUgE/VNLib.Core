# VNLib.Plugins

A compact and simple contract interface and supporting types for runtime loadable plugins. It implements types that may be used outside the scope of **VNLib.Plugins.Essentials** library, but the contract types were designed for use with it, which is why they are opinionated. 

**This library has no internal or external dependencies**

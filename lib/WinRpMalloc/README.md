## RPMalloc

[**RPMalloc**](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc) By Mattias Jansson - A cross-platform, lock-free, efficient memory allocator. 


#### Notes
This project exists to maintain a working clone of of the RpMalloc library specifically to produce a Windows 64-bit native library that exposes the api for use by runtimes such as Microsft .NET. 

You may wish to collect the source code and build the library yourself directly from Mattias's.

# VNLib.Net.Http

Provides a compact, resource efficient, high performance, single library HTTP(s) server, with extensible processors and transport providers so its not opinionated. You can use this library to add HTTP processing to any .NETCore project with no external dependencies. If you want to do normal web handling (more than the bare HTTP protocol) consider adding the [Plugins.Essentials](../Plugins.Essentials/#) library to your project.

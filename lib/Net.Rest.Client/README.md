# VNLib.Net.Rest.Client

Provides helpful extensions for rapid development of rest client libraries. Thread safe client pooling, endpoint construction framework, and OAuth2 authentication implementation.

### Third party deps  
This library relies on the [RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp) rest client library. This may change in the future for a higher-performance alternative, but for now I really like RestSharp and it is currently well supported. 

## Builds
Debug build w/ symbols & xml docs, release builds, NuGet packages, and individually packaged source code are available on my website (link below). All tar-gzip (.tgz) files will have an associated .sha384 appended checksum of the desired download file.

## Docs and Guides
Documentation, specifications, and setup guides are available on my website.

vnlib_rpmalloc Copyright (C) 2024 Vaughn Nugent

vnlib_rpmalloc is a wrapper library for rpmalloc by Mattias Jansson that implements the NativeHeapApi 
functions, and exports them by default for use as a library. The CMake configuration is setup to produce both
a static and shared library you can link against. The NativeHeapApi.h file is included in the source tree
of the archive this readme is included in. Simply add the header to your project and link against the library.

The NativHeapApi was designed to consolidate heap based operations into a single interface for the purpose of
.NET interop. The shared library (DLL) that is produced can be loaded into a .NET application that uses 
my VNLib.Utils library. 

LICENSE:
You also received a copy of the license for rpmalloc by Mattias Jansson, and a GNU license for this library.

INSTALLATION:
For the most up-to-date instructions go to my website here: https://www.vaughnnugent.com/resources/software/articles?tags=docs&search=building+native+heap

If you cannot view the website, here are the basic instructions that may become outdated:

PREREQUISITES:
- Taskfile.dev (https://taskfile.dev/#/installation)
- CMake (https://cmake.org/download/)
- MSBuild (Vistual Studio build tools) and the CL.exe compiler-linker (Windows only)
- GNU Make + GCC (Unix only)

BUILDING:
1. You have already downloaded all the source code to build this library 
2. Navigate to directory containing the Taskfile.yaml file in the root
3. Run the default task: > task (yes literally just type "task" and hit enter if you installed Task gobally)

WINDOWS:
The taskfile should print on screen where the output library file was placed. It will be in the build directory
usually under Debug or Release.

UNIX:
Navigate to the build directory after the task completes, and both the shared .so and static .a files will be
in the build directory.

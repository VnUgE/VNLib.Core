# VNLib.Plugins.Runtime

A structured library for implementing runtime-loaded assemblies that expose types that implement the IPlugin runtime type and manages their lifecycle including unload-able (collectible) assemblies. Type instances are fully managed and carefully exposed as to safely control an instance's lifecycle. 

**This library has no external dependencies**

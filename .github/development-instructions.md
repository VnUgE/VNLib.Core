This repository is called VNLib.Core. It's a large mono repo with many projects nested inside it. Applications and libraries are grouped by their purpose and usually namespaced accordingly. A repository is called a module and has a collection of projects. Projects within a module are publically available and can be used by other modules or applications both inside and outside development of VNLib products. 

We use a mix of programming languages with our own paradigms and idioms. Projects are mostly written in C# and C11 when possible. Always conform to the coding styles defined in styleguide-<language>.md files for each language found in the .github/ directory. When generating code adhere strictly to the styleguide for the language you are generating code for to most closely relate to the existing codebase. 

It is important that your code is maintainable, readable, and follows the principles of clean code. This means using meaningful names, keeping functions small and focused, and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
